                        <h2>Survey Form</h2>
                         <p>My first freeCodeCamp certification project. The idea was to create a survey form that could be submitted, typically used for business reviews, however I opted to put a creative spin on the project. The end user would use the form to describe their pet and then after hitting submit, they would receive an email with a guess as to what animal they own! Pretty nifty right?</p>

                            <h2>Tribute Page</h2>
                             <p>This was my second freeCodeCamp certification project, in which the goal was to create a tribute page for a topic, event or person. I chose to create a timeline for Daft Punk, one of my favorite musical duos, in a style I felt was simple yet faithful to their brand.</p>
