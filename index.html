                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I currently work at a major university in Virginia as a Computer Labs Specialist. I offer immediate support to students for a range of technical problems as well as help our computer lab technicians with setting up the labs when requested.</p>
                <p> I have a desire to enter the fields of development and/or design because I have a passion for creating tangible work. In my free time I occupy myself with a variety of hobbies, including but not limited to, web development, and graphic design. I am also slowly teaching myself game development, 3d modeling and sound design.</p>
                <p>When not pursuing various technological interests and hobbies, I am spending time at home with my husband and two cats, Sigi and Momo, and occasionally engaging in an outdoor activity.</p>

                <h2>Skills and Certifications</h2>
                <p>I have several project sites that I work on in my spare time, most are usually under construction as I use them to test new ideas as I learn. Currently, I have been updating this portfolio site, and attempting to learn next.js by reworking my blog site in my spare time.</p>
                <p>In addition to the projects I have linked on top of the page, I have completed a Responsive Web Design certification, (HTML + CSS), through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"> FreeCodeCamp</a>. FreeCodeCamp recently updated their certifications and now offers a Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum in place of the Responsive Web Design. I have begun working along the newly offered certification, which includes Javascript, and React, as well as HTML and CSS.</p>
                <p>I have earned my CompTIA ITF+ certification, and I am currently studying to take the A+. I also have several certifications for the Microsoft Suite: Excel, Outlook, Powerpoint, and Word.</p>
